    <h2>Origin</h2>

        <p>Vain, egotistic surgeon Stephen Strange lost the use of his hands in a horrific auto accident caused by his own recklessness. In turn, he lost his fortune through a series of costly, complicated and experimental surgeries and therapies in an attempt to save his livelihood. In the end, destitute and desperate, he sought a cure far off the beaten path of modern medicine.
            In Nepal, after being saved from muggers by the powerful sorcerer Mordo, Strange met the person who had taught Mordo—Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, who held many mysteries of the Old World, including the potential to heal Strange’s hands. The Ancient One refused to guide Strange through the process until he relinquished his selfishness and opened his mind to a higher truth. Having done so, the doctor began to learn of the Multiverse and the ancient science of magic, as well as forbidden knowledge the Ancient One was not inclined to share.</p>
